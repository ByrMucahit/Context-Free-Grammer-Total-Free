# Context-Free-Grammer-Total-Free
Total free is term of Automata theory.

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>For a given CFG we define a tree with the start symbol S as its root and
whose nodes are working strings of terminals and nonterminals. The descendants of each node are all the possible results of applying every production
to the working string, one at a time. A string of all terminals is a terminal
node in the tree. The resultant tree is called the total language tree of the
CFG. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For the CFG </p>

                                            S --> aa | bX | aXX
                                            X --> ab | b
<p>The total language tree is :</p>

<p>This total language has only seven different words. Four of its words (abb,
aabb, abab, aabab) have two different possible derivations because they appear
as terminal nodes in this total language tree in two different places. However,
the words are not generated by two different derivation trees and the grammar
is unambiguous. For example:<p/>
